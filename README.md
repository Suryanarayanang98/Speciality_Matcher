# Speciality Mapper

The Speciality Mapper is a Python tool aimed at providing accurate mapping of medical specialties to their corresponding taxonomy codes. This tool offers a robust set of features tailored to meet the diverse needs of healthcare professionals and researchers.

## Key Features

- **Exact Match**: The Speciality Mapper utilizes advanced algorithms to precisely match input medical specialties with exact entries in the provided taxonomy file. This ensures reliable and consistent mappings for a wide range of medical disciplines.

- **Fuzzy Match**: In scenarios where an exact match cannot be found, the tool employs sophisticated fuzzy matching techniques to identify closely related specialties based on user-defined similarity thresholds. This enables the system to handle variations and nuances in specialty names with high accuracy.

- **Taxonomy Code Retrieval**: Once a match is established, the Speciality Mapper retrieves the corresponding taxonomy codes associated with the mapped specialties. This facilitates seamless integration with existing healthcare databases and systems, streamlining data management processes.

- **Data Standardization**: By standardizing medical specialty names according to the entries in the taxonomy file, the tool ensures consistency and coherence in data representation. This promotes interoperability and enhances the reliability of downstream analyses and reporting.
